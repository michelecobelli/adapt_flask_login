# 🧠 ADAPT.ai — User-Personalized Project Platform (Flask + Figma Integration)

ADAPT.ai is a full-stack web application designed to give each user their own personalized dashboard where they can log in, register, and write a custom description of their design project.

The visual interface is based on a Figma-designed static prototype, which has been carefully transformed into a fully dynamic Flask application without compromising layout or styling.
